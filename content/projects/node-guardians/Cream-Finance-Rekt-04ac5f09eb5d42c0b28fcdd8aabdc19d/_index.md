Flash Loan EIP : [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156)


## Simple Summary


This ERC provides standard interfaces and processes for single-asset flash loans.


##  Abstract


A flash loan is a smart contract transaction in which a lender smart 
contract lends assets to a borrower smart contract with the condition 
that the assets are returned, plus an optional fee, before the end of 
the transaction. This ERC specifies interfaces for lenders to accept 
flash loan requests, and for borrowers to take temporary control of the 
transaction within the lender execution. The process for the safe 
execution of flash loans is also specified.


##  Motivation


Flash loans allow smart contracts to lend an amount of tokens without
 a requirement for collateral, with the condition that they must be 
returned within the same transaction.


Early adopters of the flash loan pattern have produced different 
interfaces and different use patterns. The diversification is expected 
to intensify, and with it the technical debt required to integrate with 
diverse flash lending patterns.


Some of the high level differences in the approaches across the protocols include:

- Repayment approaches at the end of the transaction, where some
pull the principal plus the fee from the loan receiver, and others where the loan receiver needs to manually return the principal and the fee to the lender.
- Some lenders offer the ability to repay the loan using a token
that is different to what was originally borrowed, which can reduce the
overall complexity of the flash transaction and gas fees.
- Some lenders offer a single entry point into the protocol
regardless of whether youâ€™re buying, selling, depositing or chaining
them together as a flash loan, whereas other protocols offer discrete
entry points.
- Some lenders allow to flash mint any amount of their native token
without charging a fee, effectively allowing flash loans bounded by
computational constraints instead of asset ownership constraints.

First thing first, I want to have a look at the current state of the vault contract:


```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "forge-std/console.sol";

import {Attack} from "../src/Attack.sol";

import {SharkVault, IERC20} from "../src/Attack.sol";

contract POC is Script {
    function run() external {

        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
        address INSTANCE = vm.envAddress("INSTANCE");

        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);


        SharkVault vault = SharkVault(INSTANCE);

        IERC20 gold = IERC20(vault.gold());
        IERC20 seagold = IERC20(vault.seagold());

        console.logAddress(address(gold));
        console.logAddress(address(seagold));
        console.logUint(gold.balanceOf(address(vault)));
        console.logUint(seagold.balanceOf(address(vault)));


        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```


which gives me the following output :

So this is our target to still !


Now here is the vault contract:

}
```


Since we are supposed to take advantage of a reentrancy attack, Iâ€™m looking for any miss ordered `[checks â†’ internal state change â†’ outside communication]` patern in the contract. In other word, I want to find something in the contract that update the internal state logic of the contract after talking with the outside world.


And here we have it :


```solidity
 function borrow(uint256 _amount) external {

        LoanAccount memory borrowerAccount = updatedAccount(msg.sender);
        borrowerAccount.borrowedSeagold += _amount;

        // Fail if insufficient remaining balance of $SEAGOLD
        uint256 seagoldBalance = seagold.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(_amount <= seagoldBalance, "Insufficient $SEAGLD to lend");

        // Fail if borrower has insufficient gold collateral
        require(_hasEnoughCollateral(borrowerAccount), "Undercollateralized $SEAGLD loan");

        // Transfer $SEAGOLD and update records
        seagold.transfer(msg.sender, _amount); <==================
        accounts[msg.sender] = borrowerAccount; <=================

    }
```


Those last two line are very dangerous since transfer can be done to any malicious contract that will recall the borrow function before the `accounnts[msg.sender]` state is updated!


The first line of the function calls `updatedAccount` :


```solidity
function updatedAccount(
        address _accountOwner
    ) public view returns (LoanAccount memory account) {

        account = accounts[_accountOwner];

        if (account.borrowedSeagold > 0) {
            uint256 blockDelta = block.number - account.lastBlock;
            uint256 interest = account.borrowedSeagold * blockDelta 
                * INTEREST_RATE_PERCENT / 100;

            account.depositedGold = (account.depositedGold >= interest) 
                ? account.depositedGold - interest 
                : 0;
        }

        account.lastBlock = block.number;

    }

```


but this call presuppose that `account = accounts[_accountOwner];` is the correct value, which we know is wrong since we can call withdraw as many time as we want without changing the `accounts[msg.sender]` . In order to create an attack, first we need so GOLD collateral. Letâ€™s see how many GOLD we can borrow from the flash lender:


![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/00345c33-b7f7-443a-aca8-598247fb6d93/890f84cd-9c23-471d-91f8-eb71c84fa3df/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240214%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240214T144959Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=9f405ad96fe241eef781c769df799b501f0954fa0203d18a50437ad8ae82365d&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


So, 1 000 Gold token.


And we want to still 3 000 SeaGold.


It is said that : For every `1000` Gold deposited, users can borrow up to `75` Seagold.


So weâ€™ll be able to `borrow` 750 Seagold on each call which is perfet since 3 000 / 750 = 4 !


So, here are the step Iâ€™m going to implement;

1. Deposit the `1000` Gold from the Flashloan contract into the SharkVault contract
1. Call `borrow()` 750 SeaGold x4 thanks to the contract breach
1. Make a last `borrow()` of 0 SeaGold so I donâ€™t have to repay anything
1. Withdraw the `1000` Gold from the SharkVault contract and repay back the Flashloan contract

Now it still remains one problem, how to take advantage of the seagold transfer method ?


looking at the decompiled version of the function from goerli scan :

and the first transaction log from my first POC (see further below) we can see that their is some call to `getInterfaceImplementer()` function:

Here is the correponding eip : [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820)


## Simple Summary


This standard defines a universal registry smart contract where any 
address (contract or regular account) can register which interface it 
supports and which smart contract is responsible for its implementation.


This standard keeps backward compatibility with [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165).


##  Abstract


This standard defines a registry where smart contracts and regular 
accounts can publish which functionality they implementâ€”either directly 
or through a proxy contract.


Anyone can query this registry to ask if a specific address 
implements a given interface and which smart contract handles its 
implementation.


This registry MAY be deployed on any chain and shares the same address on all chains.


Interfaces with zeroes (`0`) as the last 28 bytes are considered [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) interfaces,
and this registry SHALL forward the call to the contract to see if it implements the interface.


This contract also acts as an [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) cache to reduce gas consumption.


##  Motivation


There have been different approaches to define pseudo-introspection in Ethereum.
The first is [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) which has the limitation that it cannot be used by regular accounts.
The second attempt is [ERC-672](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/672) which uses reverse [ENS](https://ens.domains/). Using reverse [ENS](https://ens.domains/) has two issues. 
First, it is unnecessarily complicated, and second, [ENS](https://ens.domains/) is still a centralized contract controlled by a multisig.
This multisig theoretically would be able to modify the system.


This standard is much simpler than [ERC-672](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/672), and it is _fully_ decentralized.


This standard also provides a _unique_ address for all chains.
Thus solving the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains.


Back to the decompiled code:


```solidity
static call 0x1820a4b7618bde71dce8cdc73aab6c95905fad24.getInterfaceImplementer(address addr, bytes32 interfaceHash) with:

```


after a quick google search we can find that:

[bookmark](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc777)


So apparently, Seagold is not just an ERC20 but rather an ERC777


The question is: How can we trigger a fallback like functionality from ERC777 transfer call ?


[https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/84702](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/84702)


Here we have it :


[bookmark](https://github.com/Dawn-Protocol/dawn-erc20-erc777/blob/master/contracts/Staking.sol#L243)


We can clearly see here that if we implement the tokensReceived function we can have a re-entrancy attack:


![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/00345c33-b7f7-443a-aca8-598247fb6d93/a92b9812-e364-4481-a5e4-d551245477ff/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240214%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240214T144959Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=2e578cd7fd967d050bc7be73bb3b2471c75991ed284b7ba46ba89fe65506dbad&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


So letâ€™s implement the function in our flashloan contract + we can see that the address is called on  the return data which is the _to address from the params of the function which is msg.sender which is our flash loan contract !


![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/00345c33-b7f7-443a-aca8-598247fb6d93/ca7dfac6-2e86-42e5-91a2-a9ba70189cbe/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240214%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240214T144959Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=2f6ff0c2c041abf0cc5e429135a48c2326fa03178962f4382080b6b7d79f1657&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


Once we have implemented the function there is still one thing to do:


![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/00345c33-b7f7-443a-aca8-598247fb6d93/a3c117a4-c87e-441e-81ee-8b43f01fa31c/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240214%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240214T144959Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=4c53e0f8ae4885e179757a2b533958d16c0ce3ccc8e71e29b5a8c2502fe4e646&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


We can see that there is no interface implementer registered, so there are no call that is made here :


```solidity
if ext_call.return_data[12 len 20]:
      require ext_code.size(addr(ext_call.return_data))
      call addr(ext_call.return_data).tokensReceived(address param1, address param2, address param3, uint256 param4, bytes param5, bytes param6) with:
           gas gas_remaining wei
          args caller, caller, addr(_to), _value, 192, 224, 0, 0
```


ext_call.return_data is the result of getInterfaceImplementer.


So first we have to find a way to add an interface implementer in the ERC1830Registry.


We can do so with the following function:


```solidity
/// @notice Sets the contract which implements a specific interface for an address.
/// Only the manager defined for that address can set it.
/// (Each address is the manager for itself until it sets a new manager.)
/// @param _addr Address for which to set the interface.
/// (If '_addr' is the zero address then 'msg.sender' is assumed.)
/// @param _interfaceHash Keccak256 hash of the name of the interface as a string.
/// E.g., 'web3.utils.keccak256("ERC777TokensRecipient")' for the 'ERC777TokensRecipient' interface.
/// @param _implementer Contract address implementing '_interfaceHash' for '_addr'.
function setInterfaceImplementer(address _addr, bytes32 _interfaceHash, address _implementer) external {
    address addr = _addr == address(0) ? msg.sender : _addr;
    require(getManager(addr) == msg.sender, "Not the manager");

    require(!isERC165Interface(_interfaceHash), "Must not be an ERC165 hash");
    if (_implementer != address(0) && _implementer != msg.sender) {
        require(
            ERC1820ImplementerInterface(_implementer)
                .canImplementInterfaceForAddress(_interfaceHash, addr) == ERC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC,
            "Does not implement the interface"
        );
    }
    interfaces[addr][_interfaceHash] = _implementer;
    emit InterfaceImplementerSet(addr, _interfaceHash, _implementer);
}
```


â†’ _addr (FlashLoan address)


â†’ _interfaceHash (0xb281fc8c12954d22544db45de3159a39272895b169a852b314f9cc762e44c53b)


â†’ _interfaceHash (FlashLoan address)


So here is the call I made :


```solidity
ERC1820Registry registry = ERC1820Registry(REGISTRY);
registry.setInterfaceImplementer(address(flashLoan), 0xb281fc8c12954d22544db45de3159a39272895b169a852b314f9cc762e44c53b, address(flashLoan));
```


but I felt onto:

Question: who is the manager ?


It turns out that a contract is its own manager ! hehe


So I moved my code inside my FlashLoan attacker ðŸ˜ˆ


And here is a first peek at my set up:
