<u>**Rekt article:**</u> [https://rekt.news/cream-rekt/](https://rekt.news/cream-rekt/)


The goal of this challenge is to seize all of the $SEAGOLD supply from `SharkVault`.


![](/images/379abe9f-63f6-45bf-8f6c-abe200f42288.png)


From the subject, we can understand that we are able to request for overcollateralized loan to the shark vault.


![](/images/b3f31e34-7ec2-4ac1-b250-14b5931c4976.png)


We can then repay the loan in the opposite direction and withdraw our collateral - fees.


![](/images/673f0a47-d91f-4873-af73-f62ccb0b7b59.png)


Finally, their is a liquidation mecanism if the position become undercollateralized.


First thing first, I want to have a look at the current state of the vault contract, here is a simple script to logs the current balances of Gold and Seagold of the Sharkvault:


```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "forge-std/console.sol";

import {Attack} from "../src/Attack.sol";

import {SharkVault, IERC20} from "../src/Attack.sol";

contract POC is Script {
    function run() external {

        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
        address INSTANCE = vm.envAddress("INSTANCE");

        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);


        SharkVault vault = SharkVault(INSTANCE);

        IERC20 gold = IERC20(vault.gold());
        IERC20 seagold = IERC20(vault.seagold());

        console.logAddress(address(gold)); // logs the gold token address
        console.logAddress(address(seagold)); // logs the seagold token address
        console.logUint(gold.balanceOf(address(vault))); // logs the amount gold in the vault
        console.logUint(seagold.balanceOf(address(vault))); // logs the amount of seagold in the vault


        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```


which gives me the following output :


![](/images/d77a8fc9-bff8-4e31-8f60-59bb6cbce852.png)


So there are 3000000000000000000000 unit of $Seagold in the contract to be stolen !


Now here is the vault contract code :


```solidity

From reding the Cream Finance post moterm, we can easily suppose that their is a reentrancy vulnerability inside this contract so Iâ€™m looking for any miss ordered `[Checks â†’ Effects â†’ Interactions]` pattern in the contract. 


You can find nice description of this pattern inside the solidity documentation: 


![](/images/34f88230-0d68-4fbe-9cb3-85f673eff7fe.png)


In other word, we want to find something in the contract that update the internal state of the contract after talking with the outside world.


And here we have it :


```solidity
 function borrow(uint256 _amount) external {

        LoanAccount memory borrowerAccount = updatedAccount(msg.sender); // local state
        borrowerAccount.borrowedSeagold += _amount; // local state

        // Fail if insufficient remaining balance of $SEAGOLD
        uint256 seagoldBalance = seagold.balanceOf(address(this)); // local state
        require(_amount <= seagoldBalance, "Insufficient $SEAGLD to lend"); // 1st Check

        // Fail if borrower has insufficient gold collateral
        require(_hasEnoughCollateral(borrowerAccount), "Undercollateralized $SEAGLD loan"); // 2d Check

				//--- DANGER ZONE ---//
				
        // Transfer $SEAGOLD and update records
        seagold.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);  // Interaction (outside world communication)
        accounts[msg.sender] = borrowerAccount; // Effect (internal state change)

    }
```


Those last two line are very dangerous since transfer can be done to any malicious contract that will recall the borrow function before the `accounnts[msg.sender]` state is updated, breaking the internal state logic of the contract !


The first line of the method calls `updatedAccount` here you have the code of this method :


```solidity
function updatedAccount(
        address _accountOwner
    ) public view returns (LoanAccount memory account) {

        // we can't rely on this value
        // since borrow can be called multiple times (recursion pattern)
        // before it updates the accounts
				account = accounts[_accountOwner];

        if (account.borrowedSeagold > 0) {
            uint256 blockDelta = block.number - account.lastBlock;
            uint256 interest = account.borrowedSeagold * blockDelta 
                * INTEREST_RATE_PERCENT / 100;

            account.depositedGold = (account.depositedGold >= interest) 
                ? account.depositedGold - interest 
                : 0;
        }

        account.lastBlock = block.number;

    }

```


but this call presuppose that `account = accounts[_accountOwner];` is the correct value, which we know is wrong since we can call `borrow` as many time as we want without changing the `accounts[msg.sender]` .


Now, we know there is a vulnerability inside the Sharkvault contract. In order to interact with the borrow method, we first need to deposit some $Gold collateral into it. Donâ€™t forget that we have access to another contract:  the flash lender !


![](/images/933ad9cf-d32b-4df5-90c7-e1468c891042.png)


Letâ€™s see how many $Gold we can get from the flash loan:


![](/images/890f84cd-9c23-471d-91f8-eb71c84fa3df.png)


So, 1 000 Gold token.


And we want to still 3 000 SeaGold.


It is said that : For every `1000` Gold deposited, users can borrow up to `75` Seagold.


So weâ€™ll be able to `borrow` 750 Seagold on each call which is perfet since 3 000 / 750 = 4 !


So, here are the step Iâ€™m going to implement;

1. Ask for a flash loan of `1000` Gold to the falsh lender
1. Deposit the `1000` Gold from the Flashloan contract into the SharkVault contract
1. Make a `borrow()` of 0 SeaGold so I donâ€™t have to repay anything at the end of the call call
1. Call `borrow()` 750 SeaGold x4 thanks to the contract breach
1. Withdraw the `1000` Gold from the SharkVault contract and repay back the Flashloan contract

Here is another point of view from a contract state perspective:


 


![](/images/766206a6-f30b-45f4-9feb-0d6069f2a0d7.gif)


you can play with the animation here 


[image](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/00345c33-b7f7-443a-aca8-598247fb6d93/e53c7ace-a866-4ff8-b2d0-377d311be1ff/excalidraw-claymate%283%29.html?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240319%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240319T165404Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=1286b70636a80314858b561e03f76b2bdca2d34cf722afa99ac27a797d950d95&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


Now it still remains one problem, how to take advantage of the Seagold `transfer` method ?

          args caller, caller, addr(_to), _value, 192, 224, 0, 0
      if not ext_call.success:
          revert with ext_call.return_data[0 len return_data.size]
  return 1
```


and the first transaction log from my first POC (see further below) we can see that their is some call to `getInterfaceImplementer()` function:


![](/images/427c63e2-b8fe-4244-81c2-e8726a8c6a11.png)


Here is the correponding eip : [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820)


Back to the decompiled code:


```solidity
static call 0x1820a4b7618bde71dce8cdc73aab6c95905fad24.getInterfaceImplementer(address addr, bytes32 interfaceHash) with:
          gas gas_remaining wei
         args addr(_to), 0xb281fc8c12954d22544db45de3159a39272895b169a852b314f9cc762e44c53b
```


after a quick google search we can find that:

[bookmark](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc777)


So apparently, Seagold is not just an ERC20 but rather an ERC777


The question is: How can we trigger a fallback like functionality from ERC777 transfer call ?


[https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/84702](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/84702)


Here we have it :


[bookmark](https://github.com/Dawn-Protocol/dawn-erc20-erc777/blob/master/contracts/Staking.sol#L243)


We can clearly see here that if we implement the tokensReceived function we can have a re-entrancy attack:


![](/images/a92b9812-e364-4481-a5e4-d551245477ff.png)


So letâ€™s implement the function in our flashloan contract + we can see that the address is called on  the return data which is the _to address from the params of the function which is msg.sender which is our flash loan contract !


![](/images/ca7dfac6-2e86-42e5-91a2-a9ba70189cbe.png)


Once we have implemented the function there is still one thing to do:


![](/images/a3c117a4-c87e-441e-81ee-8b43f01fa31c.png)


We can see that there is no interface implementer registered, so there are no call that is made here :


```solidity
if ext_call.return_data[12 len 20]:
      require ext_code.size(addr(ext_call.return_data))
      call addr(ext_call.return_data).tokensReceived(address param1, address param2, address param3, uint256 param4, bytes param5, bytes param6) with:
           gas gas_remaining wei
          args caller, caller, addr(_to), _value, 192, 224, 0, 0
```


ext_call.return_data is the result of getInterfaceImplementer.


So first we have to find a way to add an interface implementer in the ERC1830Registry.


We can do so with the following function:


```solidity
/// @notice Sets the contract which implements a specific interface for an address.
/// Only the manager defined for that address can set it.
/// (Each address is the manager for itself until it sets a new manager.)
/// @param _addr Address for which to set the interface.
/// (If '_addr' is the zero address then 'msg.sender' is assumed.)
/// @param _interfaceHash Keccak256 hash of the name of the interface as a string.
/// E.g., 'web3.utils.keccak256("ERC777TokensRecipient")' for the 'ERC777TokensRecipient' interface.
/// @param _implementer Contract address implementing '_interfaceHash' for '_addr'.
function setInterfaceImplementer(address _addr, bytes32 _interfaceHash, address _implementer) external {
    address addr = _addr == address(0) ? msg.sender : _addr;
    require(getManager(addr) == msg.sender, "Not the manager");

    require(!isERC165Interface(_interfaceHash), "Must not be an ERC165 hash");
    if (_implementer != address(0) && _implementer != msg.sender) {
        require(
            ERC1820ImplementerInterface(_implementer)
                .canImplementInterfaceForAddress(_interfaceHash, addr) == ERC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC,
            "Does not implement the interface"
        );
    }
    interfaces[addr][_interfaceHash] = _implementer;
    emit InterfaceImplementerSet(addr, _interfaceHash, _implementer);
}
```


â†’ _addr (FlashLoan address)


â†’ _interfaceHash (0xb281fc8c12954d22544db45de3159a39272895b169a852b314f9cc762e44c53b)


â†’ _interfaceHash (FlashLoan address)


So here is the call I make :


```solidity
ERC1820Registry registry = ERC1820Registry(REGISTRY);
registry.setInterfaceImplementer(address(flashLoan), 0xb281fc8c12954d22544db45de3159a39272895b169a852b314f9cc762e44c53b, address(flashLoan));
```


but I felt onto:


![](/images/8df87b9b-3bbf-40b6-a273-28ceb0f98bd3.png)


Question: who is the manager ?


It turns out that a contract is its own manager ! hehe


So I moved my code inside my FlashLoan attacker ðŸ˜ˆ


And here is a first peek at my set up:
