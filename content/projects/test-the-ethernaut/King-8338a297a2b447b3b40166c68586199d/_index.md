The contract below represents a very simple game: whoever sends it an amount of ether that is larger than the current prize becomes the new king. On such an event, the overthrown king gets paid the new prize, making a bit of ether in the process! As ponzi as it gets xD


Such a fun game. Your goal is to break it.


When you submit the instance back to the level, the level is going to reclaim kingship. You will beat the level if you can avoid such a self proclamation.

This solution is overkill since we can just forbid the to send ether to a contract just by not implementing any fallback function. But this solution is more fun since it‚Äôs like TheOnlyOneKing is always fighting back for his crown ! üëë
